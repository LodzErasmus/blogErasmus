            Objectives & outcomes: 
            To deepen your understanding of and provide an opening into the human, cultural, economic, and geo-political aspects of your host city, region, or country, during your semester 6 Erasmus experience.
            Deliverable:
            Set up and maintain a blog. 
            Key dates:
            19/01/2023:  pre-departure team presentation, 20 minutes (Angers students)
            30/06/2022:  finalize your blog
            
            Methodology & steps:
            1.	Set up teams of 2 to 5 students at the same host destination. These may combine IR and GRE students. 
            2.	Set up your blog. You choose your own platform and hosting service. Add the following information to your blog: geographical location, university, population, interesting places to see, how to get there, student life, public transport, tips from 4th-year students etc
            3.	Pre-departure team presentation, 19/01/2023 (for Angers): 20 minutes, using your blog as a visual support. Showcase your initial research, talk about your expectations, ambitions, sources of potential culture shock, and how you will mitigate this. Use the tools and skills delivered during the S5 International Culture sessions.
            4.	*31/01/2023 to 30/06/2023: produce your blog: * depending on departure date
            	Each team member produces and publishes 1 article every three weeks (see dates below**). Articles will be 400 (+/-10%) , in English. They must include a headline and at least two sources. They must be edited by the team, be fact-checked, and present truthful, objective information. Remember, these articles will be visible online, in the public domain, so it is not in your interest to write false stories. If there is a doubt about the authenticity of an article, you will receive 0/20. Plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in 0/20. Articles should be accompanied by 1-2 photos each, with captions.
            	Each team creates and publishes at least two photo stories. Photo stories must include at least 4 photographs with captions and a headline. The four photographs must show different angles, people, or elements of a single story. In other words, they must be diverse, yet cohesive. Four photographs of the same person or thing are not acceptable. Photographs of your friends posing in front of various locations are not acceptable as part of a photo story.
            	Each team will produce and publish two videos. Videos will be 2 to 3 minutes and must include some form of interview, as well as panning a scene to give context. Videos of landscapes with only a musical soundtrack are not acceptable. If you use music as part of a video, check that it is royalty-free, and give credit at the end. If your blog does not support video publication, upload your video to YouTube (or an appropriate video-sharing platform) and provide a link in the blog.
